# Namespace

Namespaces allows you to publish and manage content that is subject to a release process.

Artefacts produced from [Tasks and Pipelines](tasksandpipelines.md) can be organized into namespaces.

Namespaces are accessible from the web interface:

    https://your.instance.com/namespace/<namespace>

Only administrators are allowed (for now) to publish in top layer ones, standard users have access only to namespaces which prefixes with their username.
